    - CVEs Exploited:
        - CVE-2025-55182
    - Common Usernames and Passwords Attempted:
        - Usernames: None
        - Passwords: None
    - OS Distribution of Attackers Based on p0f Data:
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x: 2229
        - Windows NT kernel 5.x: 110
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (barebone): 79
        - Linux 3.11 and newer: 44
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (no timestamps): 19
        - Mac OS X: 16
        - Windows NT kernel: 15
    - Hyper-aggressive IP Addresses:
        - 46.19.137.194 (71 attacks)
    - Unusual or Specific Usernames/Passwords: None
    - Attacker Signatures, Comments, or Taunts: No explicit taunts or comments were identified. However, the following alert signatures could be considered attacker "signatures": GPL INFO VNC server response, ET DROP Dshield Block Listed Source group 1.
    - Blatant Malware or Botnet Filenames: None explicitly identified in the provided log data.
    - Other Notable Deviations from Background Noise: The high prevalence of "Misc activity" and "Misc Attack" categories suggests a wide range of probing and opportunistic attacks. The exploitation of CVE-2025-55182 indicates attempts to leverage specific vulnerabilities. The significant number of attacks from a single IP (46.19.137.194) points to a potentially automated or targeted campaign from that source.
