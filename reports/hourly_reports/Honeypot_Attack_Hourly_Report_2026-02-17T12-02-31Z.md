    - OS Distribution of Attackers Based on p0f Data:
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x: 29216
        - Windows 7 or 8: 1394
        - Mac OS X: 354
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (barebone): 295
        - Windows NT kernel 5.x: 229
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (no timestamps): 196
        - Linux 3.11 and newer: 175

    - Hyper-aggressive IP Addresses:
        - 110.49.3.20 (1346 attacks)
    - Unusual or Specific Usernames/Passwords:
        - Usernames: solana, trader, trading, eth (suggesting potential targeting of cryptocurrency-related systems or specific services)
        - Passwords: 1q2w3e4r, password1, P@ssw0rd (potentially indicative of specific dictionary attacks or commonly used insecure passwords)
    - Attacker Signatures, Comments, or Taunts:
        - No explicit attacker signatures, comments, or taunts were detected in the analyzed logs.
    - Blatant Malware or Botnet Filenames:
        - No blatant malware or botnet filenames were explicitly identified in the analyzed logs.
    - Other Notable Deviations from Background Noise:
        - A high volume of "GPL INFO VNC server response" (6166 occurrences) suggests widespread scanning and reconnaissance activity targeting VNC services.
        - "Misc activity" (6261 occurrences) and "Generic Protocol Command Decode" (460 occurrences) indicate a significant amount of general network scanning and unusual protocol interactions.
        - Consistent attempts to access common ports like 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 445 (SMB), and various high-numbered ports across different attacking countries suggest broad opportunistic scanning and potential brute-force attempts.
        - The presence of CVEs like CVE-2019-11500, CVE-2021-3449, CVE-2023-46604, CVE-2024-14007, and CVE-2025-55182, even with low counts, indicates attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities.
