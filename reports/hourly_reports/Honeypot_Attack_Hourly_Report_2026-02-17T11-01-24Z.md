- Executive Summary:
  The honeypot network detected a total of 4650 attacks in the last hour. The United States and Thailand were the top attacking countries. A significant portion of the attacks originated from "known attacker" IPs. The most frequent alert signatures were related to VNC server responses and truncated packets. Common brute-force attempts targeted "ubuntu" and "root" usernames with passwords like "123456" and "admin123".
