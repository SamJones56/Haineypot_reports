    - OS Distribution of Attackers Based on p0f Data:
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x: 20561
        - Windows NT kernel: 5030
        - Mac OS X: 426
        - Windows NT kernel 5.x: 317
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (barebone): 222
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (no timestamps): 167
        - Linux 3.11 and newer: 109
        - Linux 2.4.x-2.6.x: 6
        - Linux 3.x: 5
        - FreeBSD: 3
    - Hyper-aggressive IP Addresses:
        - 173.249.6.152 (France) with 4477 attacks stands out as exceptionally aggressive, accounting for a significant portion of the total attacks.
        - Other notable aggressive IPs include 139.59.69.34 (India) with 544 attacks and 103.204.164.37 (India) with 515 attacks.
    - Unusual or Specific Usernames/Passwords:
        - No overtly unusual or specific usernames/passwords that suggest a targeted campaign outside of common defaults like "root" and "admin" and simple numerical sequences. The presence of an empty string as a password attempt is notable. "ali", "bot", "botuser", "bob", "aaa", "abc", "adam" as usernames are also typical of automated attacks. "alex" as password can be noted.
    - Attacker Signatures, Comments, or Taunts:
        - No explicit attacker "signatures," comments, or taunts were found in the provided alert signatures or other data.
    - Blatant Malware or Botnet Filenames:
        - No blatant malware or botnet filenames were found in the provided data.
    - Other Notable Deviations from Background Noise:
        - The high volume of "GPL INFO VNC server response" (7963) and "SURICATA IPv4 truncated packet" / "SURICATA AF-PACKET truncated packet" (both 1963) alerts suggest widespread scanning or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities related to VNC or general network probing.
        - The significant number of attacks targeting port 1433 (MS SQL) from France, particularly from the hyper-aggressive IP 173.249.6.152, indicates a focused effort against database services.
        - The presence of "ET DROP Dshield Block Listed Source group 1" indicates that some attacking IPs are recognized as malicious by Dshield.
        - The exploitation of recent CVEs like CVE-2024-14007 and CVE-2025-55182, even if in small numbers, is noteworthy and indicates active exploitation attempts for newer vulnerabilities.
