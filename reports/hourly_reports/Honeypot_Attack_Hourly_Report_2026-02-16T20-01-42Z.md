    - OS Distribution of Attackers Based on p0f Data:
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x: 35365
        - Windows XP: 785
        - Mac OS X: 705
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (barebone): 397
        - Windows NT kernel 5.x: 349
        - Linux 2.2.x-3.x (no timestamps): 265
        - Linux 3.11 and newer: 216
        - Windows NT kernel: 34
        - Linux 2.4.x-2.6.x: 7
        - Windows 7 or 8: 6
    - Hyper-aggressive IP Addresses:
        - 144.130.11.9 (785 attacks) - This IP address from Australia (ASN 1221, Telstra Limited) stands out with a significantly higher number of attacks compared to others, indicating highly aggressive activity.
    - Unusual or Specific Usernames/Passwords:
        - "sol" and "solana" as usernames, and empty string passwords could indicate automated scans targeting default credentials or specific applications.
        - "4rfv$RFV" as a password attempt is less common and might suggest a dictionary attack or specific brute-force attempt.
    - Attacker Signatures, Comments, or Taunts:
        - No explicit attacker signatures, comments, or taunts were found in the provided log data.
    - Blatant Malware or Botnet Filenames:
        - No blatant malware or botnet filenames were explicitly identified in the provided log data.
    - Other Notable Deviations from Background Noise:
        - The high number of "GPL INFO VNC server response" alerts (10949) suggests a significant amount of VNC-related reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.
        - The presence of "SURICATA IPv4 truncated packet" and "SURICATA AF-PACKET truncated packet" alerts indicates potentially malformed packets or network issues that could be indicative of evasion techniques or network instability under attack.
        - The exploitation of CVEs, specifically "CVE-2025-55182", "CVE-2002-0013", "CVE-2002-0012", and "CVE-2024-14007", points to attempts to leverage known vulnerabilities.
