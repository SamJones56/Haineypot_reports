# Zero-Day Candidate Triage Report

### 1. Investigation Scope
- **investigation_start:** 2026-02-27T23:30:30Z
- **investigation_end:** 2026-02-28T00:00:31Z
- **completion_status:** Partial (degraded evidence)
- **notes:** The investigation was completed, but the initial analysis path was blocked by a data inconsistency. An aggregated alert for `CVE-2024-14007` was present, but the corresponding raw event could not be retrieved using the CVE identifier. A successful workaround using a broader query was required to find and invalidate the signal.

### 2. Candidate Discovery Summary
The 30-minute investigation window was overwhelmingly dominated by high-volume, automated scanning for a known VNC vulnerability (`CVE-2006-2369`). An initial high-priority signal for a recent CVE (`CVE-2024-14007`) was investigated and conclusively determined to be a false positive, attributable to benign internet scanning activity from Censys. Additionally, a single, low-context event related to an Industrial Control System (ICS) protocol was observed and has been flagged for monitoring. No novel exploit candidates were discovered.

### 3. Emerging n-day Exploitation
*No activity matching this category was validated in the investigation window.*

### 4. Known-Exploit Exclusions
- **Commodity Exploit Scanning (CVE-2006-2369):** High-volume VNC traffic targeting port 5900. Activity is directly mapped by signatures (`ET EXPLOIT VNC Server Not Requiring Authentication`) to this well-known vulnerability. Sourced from multiple IPs, with `207.174.0.19` being the most prominent.
- **Benign Internet Scanner (False Positive):** An event initially flagged as `CVE-2024-14007` was confirmed to be a `GET /robots.txt` request from a known Censys scanner IP (`162.142.125.123`). The activity is harmless internet-wide research.
- **Commodity Credential Scanning:** Low-volume, generic SSH username and password guessing attempts targeting port 22, consistent with background internet noise.

### 5. Novel Exploit Candidates
*No candidates were validated in this category.*

### 6. Suspicious Unmapped Activity to Monitor
- **candidate_id:** MONITOR-ICS-001
- **reason:** A single, unexplained event was observed on the Conpot honeypot for the `kamstrup_protocol`.
- **notes:** This is an extremely weak signal with no evidence of an exploit or further interaction. OSINT analysis confirms this is a proprietary protocol for Operational Technology (OT) smart meters with no public evidence of active exploits. The event is likely automated discovery/scanning for ICS infrastructure. This activity will be monitored for any increase in volume or interaction depth.

### 7. Infrastructure & Behavioral Classification
- **VNC Scanning Campaign:** Sourced primarily from AS398019 (Dynu Systems Incorporated), exhibiting automated, high-frequency scanning behavior targeting port 5900 for a known vulnerability (`CVE-2006-2369`).
- **Benign Research Scanning:** Sourced from AS398324 (Censys, Inc.), conducting a legitimate, low-and-slow internet-wide scan, which was incorrectly flagged by an alert signature.
- **ICS/OT Probing:** An isolated and un-attributed probe was detected against an ICS honeypot, indicative of specialized reconnaissance.

### 8. Analytical Assessment
No evidence of novel zero-day exploitation was found. The threat landscape in this window was dominated by commodity scanning for a decade-old VNC vulnerability. The investigation successfully triaged and invalidated a potential recent CVE alert, identifying it as a false positive generated by a benign scanner. This highlights a potential data quality issue where signatures may be overly broad. The only unmapped activity is a single, low-confidence event related to OT protocols, which does not warrant escalation at this time but has been flagged for future monitoring. The investigation's confidence is high despite the initial data retrieval issues.

### 9. Confidence Breakdown
- **Overall Confidence:** High. The primary signals were investigated and resolved with high certainty.
- **MONITOR-ICS-001 Confidence:** Low. Based on a single, out-of-context event.

### 11. Indicators of Interest
The following IPs are associated with high-volume, commodity VNC scanning and can be considered for blocking.
- `207.174.0.19`
- `129.212.188.196`
- `129.212.179.18`
- `129.212.184.194`
- `165.245.138.210`

### 12. Backend tool issues
- **Data Inconsistency:** A discrepancy was noted between aggregated data and raw event logs. The `KnownSignalAgent`'s `get_cve` tool reported one event for `CVE-2024-14007`, but the `CandidateDiscoveryAgent`'s `kibanna_discover_query` tool failed to retrieve this event using the CVE identifier as a search term.
- **Failed Tool:** `kibanna_discover_query` (initially failed, required modified parameters for success).
- **Impact:** This issue temporarily blocked the investigation, forcing a pivot to a broader, less precise search strategy to locate the source event. This points to a potential data indexing or pipeline latency issue in the backend.
