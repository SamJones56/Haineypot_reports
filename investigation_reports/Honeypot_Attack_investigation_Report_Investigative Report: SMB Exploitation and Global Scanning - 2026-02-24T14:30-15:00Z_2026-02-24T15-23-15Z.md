# Investigative Report: Honeypot Activity Analysis
**Window:** 2026-02-24T14:30:00Z - 2026-02-24T15:00:00Z
**Incident ID:** 20260224-1430-1500
**Investigator:** Senior Cyber Threat Investigator

## 1. Investigation Scope
This report documents threat activity observed within a 30-minute UTC window. The analysis focuses on high-volume scanning, active exploitation attempts, and infrastructure patterns.

## 2. Baseline Activity Overview
- **Total Attack Volume:** 3,402 events.
- **Primary Attack Vector:** SMB (Port 445) - 2,095 events (~61.5%).
- **Top Source IP:** 189.87.56.210 (Brazil, Claro S.A.) - 2,095 events.
- **Top ASNs:** 
    - ASN 4230 (CLARO S.A.): 2,095
    - ASN 14061 (DigitalOcean): 754
- **Top Geographic Sources:** Brazil, United States, United Kingdom, India.

## 3. Significant Findings

### 3.1 Active Exploitation: DoublePulsar Backdoor (Critical)
The most critical finding involves source IP **103.158.121.141** (Indonesia, PT Anugerah Cimanuk Raya). 
- **Alert Signature:** `ET EXPLOIT [PTsecurity] DoublePulsar Backdoor installation communication`.
- **Details:** Suricata logs captured 18 hits indicating an active attempt to establish communication with or install the DoublePulsar backdoor via SMB (port 445). 
- **Analysis:** This signature is characteristic of the EternalBlue (MS17-010) exploit chain. The payloads captured (printable strings like `^Rc6^Rs6^Rs6...`) suggest automated exploitation attempts targeting unpatched legacy Windows systems.

### 3.2 High-Volume SMB Probing (High Impact)
IP **189.87.56.210** (Brazil) exhibited high-frequency probing of port 445.
- **Observed Behavior:** Repeated negotiation of SMBv1 and SMBv2 protocols. 
- **Hypothesis:** This IP is part of a large-scale reconnaissance/exploitation campaign, likely a compromised consumer node (ISP Claro S.A.) acting as a botnet worker.
- **Validation:** P0f signatures identify the source OS as "Windows 7 or 8," consistent with typical botnet infection patterns.

### 3.3 VNC and SSH Probing
- **VNC Scanning:** Significant activity on ports 5901-5905, primarily originating from US-based IPs (e.g., targeting port 5902). Suricata alert `GPL INFO VNC server response` (110 hits) suggests attackers are looking for exposed VNC instances without authentication.
- **SSH Credentials:** Common usernames `admin`, `root`, and `user` were targeted. Passwords like `654321`, `qwerty`, and `123qwe` indicate low-sophistication brute-force attempts.

## 4. Hypothesis Development and Validation

### Hypothesis 1: Active EternalBlue Campaign
- **Evidence:** Indonesian IP `103.158.121.141` triggered multiple DoublePulsar alerts. Payload analysis shows the exploit sequence initiated over SMB2.
- **Validation:** Confirmed. The signature ID 2024766 is specifically for the DoublePulsar backdoor which is often delivered via EternalBlue. 

### Hypothesis 2: Consumer Botnet Expansion
- **Evidence:** Massive volume from Brazilian consumer IP `189.87.56.210`.
- **Validation:** Confirmed. High-volume, low-complexity protocol negotiation on Port 445 from a residential ISP is a hallmark of automated botnet propagation.

## 5. Infrastructure and Behavioral Analysis
- **Infrastructure Reuse:** DigitalOcean (ASN 14061) continues to be a primary source of SSH and VNC scanning traffic, with IPs **159.65.85.38** and **157.245.110.216** being the most active.
- **Geographic Shift:** Strong concentration in Brazil (SMB targeting) and Indonesia (Active exploitation).

## 6. Analytical Conclusion
The window was dominated by a high-intensity SMB scanning and exploitation campaign. While the majority of the volume is reconnaissance/probing from a Brazilian botnet node, the active DoublePulsar backdoor communication from Indonesia indicates a high-risk exploitation attempt. The persistent targeting of SMB (445) and VNC (5901-5905) suggests a concerted effort to find and exploit legacy infrastructure and exposed remote management services.

## 7. Confidence Assessment
- **High Confidence:** Attribution of 189.87.56.210 to SMB scanning and 103.158.121.141 to DoublePulsar exploitation attempts based on Suricata and P0f evidence.
- **Moderate Confidence:** Assessment of 189.87.56.210 as a compromised consumer node based on ISP data and OS fingerprinting.
