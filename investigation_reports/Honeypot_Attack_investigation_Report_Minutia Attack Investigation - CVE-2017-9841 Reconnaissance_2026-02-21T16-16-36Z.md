**INVESTIGATION REPORT**

**Case ID:** MINUTIA-20260221-1615
**UTC Timestamp:** 2026-02-21T16:15:25Z
**Analyst:** Senior Cyber Threat Investigator

**1.0 Investigation Scope and Objective**

*   **Timeframe:** 2026-02-21T12:15:25Z to 2026-02-21T16:15:25Z.
*   **Objective:** To identify, analyze, and report on low-frequency, high-interest attack vectors ("minutia attacks"). The focus is on actors and methodologies that deviate from common, high-volume automated scanning and exploitation activities.

**2.0 Baseline Threat Landscape**

A baseline of threat activity was established to distinguish between common background noise and targeted, anomalous activity.

*   **Attack Volume:** During the 4-hour window, the honeypot network observed **13,870** total attack events. This volume establishes a baseline of significant background noise.
*   **Common Attack Vectors:** The most active source IP was `128.199.198.62`, and the most frequent CVE-related alerts were for `CVE-2024-14007`. This activity is characteristic of widespread, automated scanning.

**3.0 Lead Development: Anomalous Web Requests**

The investigation pivoted to identifying anomalous activity within the Tanner HTTP honeypot logs. A low-frequency, high-interest request was identified:

*   **Lead URI:** `/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php`
*   **Frequency:** 2 occurrences.
*   **Analytical Significance:** This URI is the precise entry point for CVE-2017-9841, a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the PHPUnit framework. This is a deliberate attempt to exploit a specific flaw.

**4.0 Hypothesis and Targeted Investigation**

*   **Hypothesis:** The actor requesting the specific URI is actively and deliberately attempting to exploit the PHPUnit RCE vulnerability (CVE-2017-9841).

A targeted query isolated all events related to this URI to a single actor and confirmed the hypothesis.

**5.0 Actor Analysis: 212.64.216.215**

*   **Actor IP:** `212.64.216.215`
*   **Geolocation:** Türkiye (TR)
*   **ASN:** 197450 (Sunucun Bilgi Iletisim Teknolojileri ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti.)
*   **User-Agent:** `python-requests/2.25.1`
*   **Timestamps of Attempts:** `2026-02-21T12:19:59Z` and `2026-02-21T12:49:43Z`

**5.1 Technical Details and Observed TTPs**

*   **Automated Tooling:** The `python-requests` user agent confirms the use of an automated script.
*   **Reconnaissance Payload:** The body of the HTTP GET request contained the payload: `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`. This is a classic reconnaissance technique used to confirm if the RCE vulnerability is present by attempting to execute a simple, non-malicious PHP function. A successful response would validate the vulnerability for a future, more intrusive attack.
*   **Targeted Intent:** The combination of the specific URI for CVE-2017-9841 and the `phpinfo()` payload demonstrates clear, targeted intent to identify and confirm a specific, high-impact vulnerability. OSINT confirms this CVE is part of CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.

**6.0 Analytical Conclusion**

*   **Nature of Activity:** Targeted reconnaissance for a known, critical RCE vulnerability.
*   **Operational Sophistication:** While using simple tools, the actor employed a logical, multi-stage approach by first confirming the vulnerability with a benign payload (`phpinfo()`) before likely attempting a more malicious exploit.
*   **Intent:** The actor's intent was to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-9841 for subsequent exploitation, which could lead to a full server compromise.
*   **Confidence Level:** **High.** Direct and unambiguous evidence links the actor, TTPs, and a specific, known vulnerability. This case highlights how a low-volume event can represent a significantly more targeted and potent threat than thousands of generic scans.

**End of Report.**
