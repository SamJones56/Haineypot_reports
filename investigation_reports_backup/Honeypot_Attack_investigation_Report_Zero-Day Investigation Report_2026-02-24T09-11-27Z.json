"assessment": "The investigation identified two main areas of concern. First, the detection of a future-dated and critical RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) with 3 alerts in the logs indicates that we are being targeted by attackers attempting to exploit this flaw. The OSINT findings confirm the severity of this vulnerability. Second, a high volume of SMB scanning activity from a specific IP address (196.203.166.97) was observed. This is a strong indication of a reconnaissance phase of an attack, possibly in preparation for a wider campaign targeting SMB vulnerabilities. The top attacking country is the United States, not Tunisia. The combination of these two events suggests that the network is being actively targeted by one or more threat actors.",
