**INVESTIGATION REPORT**

**Case ID:** IR-20260224-0415Z
**Date/Time of Investigation:** 2026-02-24 04:15:39 Z
**Investigator:** Senior Cyber Threat Investigator

**1.0 Executive Summary**

This report details the findings of an investigation into anomalous and low-frequency attack patterns observed within the honeypot network. The objective was to identify and analyze "minutia attacks"—those with low volume but high operational significance—that deviate from the baseline of automated scanning activity.

The investigation timeframe is **2026-02-24T00:15:39Z to 2026-02-24T04:15:39Z**.

The primary finding is the identification of a targeted, albeit automated, attack by an actor deploying the **"Trinity" cryptocurrency miner botnet**. The actor, originating from IP **218.205.95.162** (AS56041, China Mobile), successfully executed a complete compromise sequence against an emulated Android Debug Bridge (ADB) service. This sequence included reconnaissance, malware upload, payload execution, and cleanup.

A secondary finding involved generic reconnaissance against an emulated Industrial Control System (ICS) HTTP interface on port 50100. This activity was attributed to the **ZGrab network scanner** and assessed as non-targeted, opportunistic probing rather than a dedicated ICS-focused attack.

**2.0 Baseline Activity Analysis**

To isolate anomalous events, a baseline of network activity was first established for the 4-hour investigative window.

*   **Total Events:** 12,305
*   **Top Source Countries:** United States (5,660), United Kingdom (1,233), Russia (915).
*   **Top Attacker IPs:** The majority of events were generated by a small pool of high-frequency scanners, led by 162.243.37.252 and 157.245.36.181.

This baseline activity is characterized by high-volume, automated scanning typical of internet background noise and was excluded from deeper analysis.

**3.0 Lead #1: Android Debug Bridge (ADB) Exploitation by Trinity Botnet**

**3.1 Initial Indicators**
A query for activity on the `Adbhoney` service, which emulates the Android Debug Bridge, revealed a series of low-frequency but highly specific commands inconsistent with random scanning.

**3.2 Actor and TTPs**
The source of the attack was identified as **218.205.95.162**. This IP was the sole source of a scripted attack sequence that unfolded chronologically:
1.  **Reconnaissance:** The script first probed the device with `echo "$(getprop ro.product.name 2>/dev/null) $(whoami 2>/dev/null)"`.
2.  **Preparation:** The temporary directory was cleared with `rm -rf /data/local/tmp/*`.
3.  **Malware Upload:** The actor uploaded a file, captured by the honeypot with SHA256 hash `0d3c687ffc30e185b836b99bd07fa2b0d460a090626f6bbbd40a95b98ea70257`.
4.  **Execution:** The script then installed and ran the payload using `pm install /data/local/tmp/ufo.apk` and `am start -n com.ufo.miner/com.example.test.MainActivity`.
5.  **Verification:** The actor checked for a running process with `ps | grep trinity`.
6.  **Cleanup:** The script attempted to remove the installation file with `rm -f /data/local/tmp/ufo.apk`.

**3.3 Corroboration and OSINT Enrichment**
*   **Network IDS:** Suricata alerts independently corroborated the event, flagging an "Executable and linking format (ELF) file download" (ID 2000418) and a "ZIP file download" (ID 2000428), consistent with an APK file transfer.
*   **Threat Intelligence:** The source IP `218.205.95.162` triggered Suricata alert 2403590, indicating it is a known malicious IP on the CINS Active Threat Intelligence list.
*   **Malware Identification:** OSINT queries on the captured file hash (`0d3c...0257`) positively identified the payload as the **"Trinity" cryptominer**. Open-source intelligence confirms this malware family specifically targets exposed ADB ports and uses the process name "trinity" and filename `ufo.apk`, matching the observed evidence perfectly.

**3.4 Assessment**
The evidence provides a high-confidence conclusion that the actor at **218.205.95.162** is an operator of the Trinity botnet. The activity was a successful, automated compromise of an emulated Android device for the purpose of cryptocurrency mining. This finding represents a significant, actionable intelligence lead.

**4.0 Lead #2: Industrial Control System (ICS) Reconnaissance**

**4.1 Initial Indicators**
A query of the `Conpot` ICS honeypot revealed HTTP requests targeting port 50100.

**4.2 Actor and TTPs**
The requests originated from multiple IPs and utilized the `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 zgrab/0.x`. ZGrab is a generic application-layer scanner used for internet-wide surveys.

**4.3 Assessment**
The use of a generic web scanner against an HTTP port, without any attempt to use specialized ICS protocols (e.g., Modbus, S7comm), indicates this is not a targeted ICS attack. It is opportunistic reconnaissance searching for any open web interfaces on a non-standard port. This activity is assessed as low-sophistication background noise.

**5.0 Conclusion**

While the overall attack volume in the period was high, the investigation successfully isolated a high-priority, targeted attack from the background noise. The detailed compromise sequence executed by the Trinity botnet operator provides valuable insight into active IoT threats. This investigation highlights the importance of looking beyond high-volume statistics to identify low-frequency events that reveal specific actor TTPs and campaigns.

**Confidence Level: High**
